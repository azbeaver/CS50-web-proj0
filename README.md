Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

HarvardX: CS50W


Hello! This simple website is a personal learning project to hone my own skills with HTML, CSS
and Bootstrap. This is my first website. Going in, I had little experience with HTML and CSS, and
no experience with Bootstrap. As such, expect it to be bare-bones.

I plan on expanding upon this project as I learn more tools in the future, but these will be
created in their own separate repositories. I will provide the links below, but they can also be
found on my GitHub page.

NOTE: this is public because I am not formally taking this course.
